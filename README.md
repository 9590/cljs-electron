# Clojurified AtomShell

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gonzih/cljs-figwheel-atom-shell-hello-world/master/demo.gif)

My attempt to recreate ClojureScript development workflow while developing desktop apps with atom-shell.

## What is currently included

* ClojureScript (init script and ui code)
* Figwheel for interactive development (+ serving of webjars)
* Reagent for UI

## Running it

```shell
foreman start # will compile cljs
atom-shell .
```
